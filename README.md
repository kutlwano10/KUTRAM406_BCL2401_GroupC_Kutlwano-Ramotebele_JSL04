# Ternary Operators Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to delve into the realm of ternary operators in JavaScript. By completing these challenges, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how ternary operators can be used to enhance code readability and efficiency.

## Challenges
it was implementing a simple if-else statement into a ternary statement .It was kinda challenging to get used to it. Comparing the difference between if-else statement to ternary operators was more confusing to me.

## Improvements 

I plan to explore additional use cases to that i can understand it way more better.also i want to use it on larger projects so that i can understand it way more better.
